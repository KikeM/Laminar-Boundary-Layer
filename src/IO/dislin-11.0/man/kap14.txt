                   Chapter 14: Contouring

This  chapter  describes  routines  for  contouring   three-
dimensional functions of the form  Z = F(X,Y).  Contours can
be generated with the routine CONPTS  or with other software
packages  and  plotted  with  the  routine  CONCRV or can be
calculated and plotted by  DISLIN  with the routines CONMAT,
CONTUR and CONSHD.

14.1 Plotting Contours

                         C O N C R V

CONCRV plots contours generated by other software packages.

The call is:  CALL CONCRV (XRAY, YRAY, N, ZLEV)   level 2, 3

XRAY, YRAY    are arrays containing the X- and Y-coordinates
              of a contour line.
N             is the number of points.
ZLEV          is a function value used for labels.

                         C O N T U R

The routine  CONTUR  calculates  and plots  contours  of the
function Z = F(X,Y).

The call is:   CALL CONTUR (XRAY, N, YRAY, M, ZMAT, ZLEV)
                                                  level 2, 3

XRAY           is an array containing X-coordinates.
N              is the dimension of XRAY.
YRAY           is an array containing Y-coordinates.
M              is the dimension of YRAY.
ZMAT           is a  matrix  of the dimension (N, M) contai-
               ning function values.
ZLEV           is a function value that defines  the contour
               line to be  calculated.  ZLEV can be used for
               labels.

                         C O N M A T

The routine  CONMAT  plots  contours  of the  function   Z = 
F(X,Y).  The function values  correspond to a linear grid in
the XY-plane.

The call is:  CALL CONMAT (ZMAT, N, M, ZLEV)      level 2, 3

ZMAT          is a  matrix of the  dimension  (N, M) contai-
              ning the function values. If XA, XE, YA and YE
              are  the axis limits in GRAF or values defined
              with  the  routine  SURSZE,  the connection of
              grid points and matrix elements can be descri-
              bed by the formula:

              ZMAT(I,J) = F(X,Y)  where
              X = XA + (I-1) * (XE - XA)/(N-1), I = 1,..,N
              Y = YA + (J-1) * (YE - YA)/(M-1), J = 1,..,M.

N, M          define the dimension of ZMAT.
ZLEV          is a function value  that defines  the contour
              line to be calculated.  The value  can be used
              for labels.

Notes:     -  CONCRV,  CONTUR  and CONMAT  use linear inter-
              polation to connect  contour points.  The rou-
              tine  TRFMAT can be used to pass a matrix with
              a better resolution to CONTUR and CONMAT.
           -  Geographical  projections  can be defined  for
              contouring.
           -  The thickness of contours can be set with THK-
              CRV.  Line styles  and colours can also be de-
              fined.  Legends are supported for  filled  and
              non-filled contours.
           -  The number of matrix points in CONTUR,  CONMAT
              and  CONPTS  is limited to N * M <= 256000  in
              Fortran 77.  There is no limit for the  C  and
              Fortran 90 libraries of DISLIN.
           -  To  plot  contours  for  randomly  distributed
              points of the form  X(N),  Y(N)  and Z(N), the
              routine  GETMAT  can be  used to  calculate  a
              function matrix, or the data can be triangula-
              ted with the routine  TRIANG  and contours can
              be plotted  from the  triangulation  with  the 
              routine CONTRI.             

                         C O N T R I

The routine  CONTRI  plots contours  from  triangulated data 
that can be calculated by the routine  TRIANG  from a set of
irregularly distributed data points.

The call is:  CALL CONTRI (XRAY, YRAY, ZRAY, N, I1RAY, 
                      I2RAY, I3RAY, NTRI, ZLEV)   level 2, 3

14.2 Plotting Filled Contours

                         C O N S H D

The routine CONSHD plots filled contours of the function Z =
F(X,Y).  Two algorithms can be selected for contour filling:
a cell filling algorithm  and a polygon  filling  algorithm.
For a polygon filling,  only closed contours  can be filled.
The algorithm can be defined with the routine SHDMOD. 

The call is:  CALL CONSHD (XRAY, N, YRAY, M, ZMAT, ZLVRAY, 
                           NLEV)                  level 2, 3

XRAY          is an array containing X-coordinates.
N             is the dimension of XRAY.
YRAY          is an array containing Y-coordinates.
M             is the dimension of YRAY.
ZMAT          is a matrix of the dimension (N, M) containing
              function values.
ZLVRAY        is an array containing the levels.  The levels
              must be sorted in ascending order if cell fil-
              ling is selected. For polygon filling, the le-
              vels should be sorted in such a way that inner
              contours are plotted last.
NLEV          is the number of levels.

Note:      -  CONSHD  may  give better  results for a higher
              resolution of  ZMAT.  A matrix  with  a higher 
              resolution can be calculated with the  routine
              TRFMAT.
           -  The colours of the  filled contours are calcu-
              lated from  a fictive colour bar where the mi-
              nimum and maximum  of the contour  levels  are
              used for the  lower  and  upper  limits of the 
              colour bar.  The scaling of the colour bar can
              be modified with the routine  ZSCALE  while  a
              colour bar can be displayed  with the  routine
              ZAXIS.  If the colours of the filled  contours
              should  not be calculated  from  a colour bar, 
              they can be defined directly  with the routine
              CONCLR.
           -  For a cell filling, the calculation of contour
              colours are  described  in the following.  The 
              levels are sorted first in ascending order. By
              default, the colour of the region between  two
              neighbouring  levels  is  calculated  from the 
              lower value of the two levels.  If you want to
              use the  upper value,  you can  define it with
              the routine SHDMOD ('UPPER', 'COLOUR'). In de-
              fault mode  (SHDMOD ('LOWER',  'COLOUR'),  the
              cells below the minimum of the levels are fil-
              led  with the  lowermost  colour of the colour
              bar, the cells above the maximum of the levels
              are filled with the  uppermost  colour  of the
              colour bar.  The plotting  of this regions can
              be suppressed with  the statement  CALL SHDMOD 
              ('NONE', 'CELL').  

                         C O N F L L

14.4 Parameter Setting Routines

                         L A B E L S

The routine LABELS defines contour labels.

The call is:  CALL LABELS (COPT, 'CONTUR')     level 1, 2, 3
COPT          is a character string defining the labels.
  = 'NONE'    means that no labels will be plotted.
  = 'FLOAT'   means that  the level  value  will be used for
              labels.
  = 'CONLAB'  means  that labels  defined  with the  routine
              CONLAB will be plotted.
                                     Default: COPT = 'NONE'.

Note:         The number of decimal places in contour labels
              can be  defined with  CALL LABDIG (NDIG, 'CON-
              TUR'). The default value for NDIG is 1.

                         L A B D I S

The routine  LABDIS defines the distance between contour la-
bels.

The call is:  CALL LABDIS (NDIS, 'CONTUR')     level 1, 2, 3

NDIS          is the distance between labels in plot coordi-
              nates.
                                         Default: NDIS = 500

                         L A B C L R

The call is:  CALL LABCLR (NCLR, 'CONTUR')     level 1, 2, 3

NCLR          is a colour value.  If NCLR = -1,  the contour
              labels  will  be  plotted  with  the   current 
              colour.

The routine  CONMOD  modifies  the appearance of contour la-
bels.  By default,  DISLIN suppresses the plotting of labels
at a position where the contour  is very curved.  To measure
the  curvature of a  contour for an interval,  DISLIN calcu-
lates the ratio between the arc length and the length of the
straight line between  the interval limits.  If the quotient
is much greater than 1,  the contour line  is very curved in
that interval.

The call is:  CALL CONMOD (XFAC, XQUOT)        level 1, 2, 3

XFAC          defines the length  of intervals  (>= 0).  The
              curvature of contours will be tested in inter-
              vals of  the  length (1 + XFAC) * W where W is
              the label length.
XQUOT         defines a upper limit for the quotient of arc
              length and length of the  straight line (> 1).
              If the quotient  is greater  than  XQUOT,  the
              plotting  of labels will  be suppressed in the
              tested interval.
                                        Default: (0.5, 1.5).

                         C O N G A P

              distance  between  contour lines and labels is
              set to XFAC * NH where  NH is the current cha-
              racter height.
                                        Default: XFAC = 0.5.

                         S H D M O D

The routine  SHDMOD  selects the algorithm  used for contour
filling, or modifies options for cell filling.

The call is:  CALL SHDMOD (COPT, CKEY)         level 1, 2, 3

CKEY          is a  character  string  containing one of the 
              following keywords:
 = 'CONTUR'   defines  the algorithm  used for  contour fil-
              ling.  COPT  can  have  the  values 'CELL' and 
              'POLY'. The default value is COPT = 'CELL'.
 = 'CELL'     modifies the cell filling algorithm.  COPT can
              have the values  'BOTH',  'UPPER', 'LOWER' and 
              'NONE'.  If COPT = 'NONE',  the filling of the
              regions below and above  the level limits  are
              suppressed. If COPT = 'UPPER',  the filling of
              the region below the  lowermost  level is sup-
              pressed. COPT = 'LOWER' means that the filling
              of the  region  above  the uppermost  level is
              suppressed. By default, both regions described
              above are filled. 
 = 'COLOR'    modifies  the  calculation of colours  for cell
              filling.  COPT  can  have  the values  'LOWER',
              'MIDDLE' and 'UPPER'.  For COPT = 'LOWER',  the
              lower value of two neighbouring  levels is used
              for colour calculation, for COPT = 'UPPER', the
              upper value of two neighbouring levels is used,
              and for COPT = 'MIDDLE',  the mean value of the
              two levels is used for colour calculation.  The 
              default value is COPT = 'LOWER'.

                         C O N C L R

The routine CONCLR defines colours for filled contour lines.

The call is:  CALL CONCLR (NCRAY, N)           level 1, 2, 3
