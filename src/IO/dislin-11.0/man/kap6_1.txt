6.2 Axis Systems

This section describes  subroutines  that allow the user  to
modify axis systems.  The position  of an  axis system,  the
size,  the scaling,  ticks,  labels  and axis titles  can be
altered in  any way.  Some of the routines defining axis at-
tributes can also be used with secondary axes. Routines that
set axis attributes can be used  for one or for any combina-
tion of axes.  The axes are identified by a character string
that can contain the characters 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' in any com-
bination.

6.2.1 Modifying the Type

                         A X S T Y P

The routine AXSTYP defines the type of an axis system.  Axis
systems  can be plotted  as rectangles or in a crossed form.
For crossed axis systems, the scaling must be linear and the
axis limits must contain the origin.

The call is:  CALL AXSTYP (COPT)                     level 1

COPT          is a character string defining the type.
 = 'RECT'     defines a rectangular axis system. 
 = 'CROSS'    defines a crossed axis system.
                                     Default: COPT = 'RECT'.

6.2.2 Modifying the Position and Size

                         A X S P O S

AXSPOS determines the position of an axis system.

The call is:  CALL AXSPOS (NXA, NYA)                 level 1

NXA, NYA      are  plot  coordinates  that  define the lower
              left  corner of  an axis  system.  By default,
              axis systems  are  centred in  the X-direction
              while  NYA  is set to the value (page height -
              300).

                         A X S O R G

AXSORG is an alternate routine for defining the position  of
a crossed axis system.

The call is:  CALL AXSORG (NX, NY)                   level 1

NX, NY        are plot coordinates  that define the position
              of the origin of a crossed axis system.

                         A X S L E N

AXSLEN defines the size of an axis system.

The call is:  CALL AXSLEN (NXL, NYL)                 level 1

NXL, NYL      are the length and height of an axis system in
              plot coordinates.  The default values  are set
              to 2/3 of the page length and height.

                         C E N T E R

A call to the routine CENTER will centre  the axis system on
the page.  All elements of an axis system, including titles,
axis labels and names, will be taken into consideration. The
centralization is done by GRAF through changing the position
of the origin. Therefore, all plotting routines called after
GRAF will work with the new origin.

The call is:  CALL CENTER                      level 1, 2, 3

Notes:     -  If there are several axis systems on the page,
              the origin  will be changed  only by the first
              call to GRAF.
           -  The character height of titles  should  be de-
              fined with HTITLE if it is different  from the
              current  character height in GRAF.

6.2.3 Axis Scaling

                         A X S S C L

This routine sets the axis scaling to logarithmic or linear.

The call is:  CALL AXSSCL (CSCL, CAX)          level 1, 2, 3

CSCL = 'LIN'  denotes linear scaling.
     = 'LOG'  denotes logarithmic scaling.
CAX           is a character string that defines the axes.
                                    Default: ('LIN', 'XYZ').

Note:         For logarithmic scaling, the corresponding pa-
              rameters in GRAF must be exponents of base 10.

                         S E T S C L

The parameters in  GRAF  will be calculated automatically by
DISLIN  if the routine  SETSCL  is used.  In this case, GRAF
must have dummy parameters in which  DISLIN returns the cal-
culated values.

The call is:  CALL SETSCL (XRAY, N, CAX)             level 1

XRAY          is a vector  that  contains  user coordinates.
              SETSCL calculates the minimum and maximum  va-
              lues  of the data and  stores them in a common
              block.
N             is the number of points in XRAY.
CAX           is a character string that defines the axes.

Notes:     -  SETSCL can be used with linear and logarithmic
              scaling and with all label types.
           -  The calculation of scaling and label values is
              done by  GRAF.  The minimum and maximum of the
              data are  always used for the lower and  upper
              limits of an axis while even values are calcu-
              lated for the labels.
           -  The number of  digits after the decimal  point
              will be set automatically.
           -  If the scaling of an axis is logarithmic,  la-
              bels will be plotted with the format 'LOG'.

                         T I C M O D

                         L O G T I C

The  appearance of minor ticks  on logarithmic axes  differs
slightly from  linear axes.  By default,  logarithmic  minor
ticks  are generated automatically if the label step is 1 or
-1 and if the number of ticks in TICKS is greater than 1. If
the step has another value, minor ticks are plotted  as spe-
cified in TICKS. This algorithm can be modified with LOGTIC.

The call is:  CALL LOGTIC (CMOD)               level 1, 2, 3

CMOD          is a character string defining the  appearance
              of logarithmic ticks.

   = 'FULL'   means that logarithmic minor ticks will be ge-
              nerated for every cycle even if the label step
              is not 1 but some other integer.
                                     Default: CMOD = 'AUTO'.

              ranges between 1 and 10.
  = "XEXP'    has the same meaning as  'EXP',  but  a  times 
              symbol is used as operator instead of an aste-
              risk.
  = 'LOG'     will plot logarithmic labels  with base 10 and
              the corresponding exponents.
  = 'CLOG'    is similar to 'LOG' except that the entire la-
              bel is  centred  below  the  tick  mark;  with

Notes:     -  The values 'LOG', 'CLOG' and 'ELOG' can be on-
              ly used with logarithmic scaling. If these la-
              bel types are used with linear scaling, DISLIN
              will change them   to 'FLOAT'.
           -  For the values  'TIME', 'HOURS' and 'SECONDS',
              the corresponding parameters in  GRAF  must be
              in seconds since midnight.
           -  For the value 'DATE',  the corresponding para-
              meters in GRAF must be  in days  since  a base
              date.  The base date  can be  defined with the
              routine BASDAT while the  number of days since
              the base date can be  calculated with the rou-
              tine INCDAT. Date labels can be modified  with
              the routine LABMOD.

              and NOLINE. This must be done using RESET.

              coordinates. If NV is positive, the space will
              be enlarged by NV plot coordinates.
