Commercial License Types

If you want to use DISLIN in a commercial environment, you have to order
a DISLIN license. Four types of licenses are available:

a) A PC License

   You may install DISLIN and develop programs with the software on a single
   PC. Multiple DISLIN distributions for different compilers can be 
   installed on that PC. The Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and MAC OSX distributions
   of DISLIN are classified as PC distributions.

b) A Workstation License
 
   You may install and use DISLIN on a single UNIX or VMS workstation. The
   number of DISLIN users on that workstation is unlimited. The DISLIN
   distributions for Sun Solaris, HP-UX, Tru64 and OpenVMS need
   a Workstation License.      

c) A Campus License

   A Campus license allows you to install DISLIN on all computers in a
   building, or in several buildings in a closed area.

d) A World License

   A World license is a Campus license without the restriction to a closed
   area.

a) A commercial DISLIN license contains a DVD with the current DISLIN
   software, documentation and source code.

b) A DISLIN license is unlimited and contains free upgrades of the source 
   code and binary distributions for a period of time. The download site
   is www.dislin.de. The time periods are one year for PC and Workstation
   licenses, and three years for Campus and World licenses.  

c) Programs linked with DISLIN can be distributed and executed on other
   machines without any royalties.
