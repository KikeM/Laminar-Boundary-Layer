                   Chapter 7: Quickplots 
                ----------------------------

This chapter  presents  quickplots  that are  collections of
DISLIN routines to display data with one command.

The following rules are applied to quickplots:

 - Quickplots call DISINI automatically if it is  not called
   before.  METAFL ('XWIN')  will  be used in  quickplots if
   METAFL is not used before.

 - On X Window terminals,  there are no calls to  ENDGRF and
   DISFIN in quickplots, they let DISLIN in level 2 or 3. If
   the variable  %ERASE  is set to 0,  following  quickplots
   will  overwrite  the graphics  window without erasing the
   window.

 - On other  terminals  such as  VGA screens, quickplots are
   terminated with DISFIN to get back to the text mode. 

Note:

 - All quickplots  have corresponding widget interfaces that
   can be executed with the command

   disgcl  quickplot 

   where  quickplot  is the name of a quickplot.  The widget
   interfaces for quickplots expect data in the form of data
   files described in chapter 8, 'Data Files'.

7.10 Scaling of Quickplots

Normally,  quickplots are scaled automatically  in the range
of the data.  This behaviour can be changed if certain vari-
ables are defined.

The variables for the X-axis are:

 - If the system variables  %XMIN and %XMAX are defined, the
   X-axis  will be scaled automatically in the range  %XMIN, 
   %XMAX.

 - If the system variables %XMIN, %XMAX, %XOR and %XSTEP are
     defined,  the  scaling  and  labeling  of the X-axis is
     completly defined by the user.

 - If the system  variable  %XAUTO  is defined and set to 1,
   the variables  %XMIN,  %XMAX,  %XOR  and  %XSTEP  will be
   ignored  and  scaling will  be done automatically  in the
   range of the data. 

Analog:  Y-axis, Z-axis.

Note:    For logarithmic scaling, the parameters must be ex-
         ponents of base 10.
