# Laminar-Boundary-Layer
Code to solve a laminar boundary layer in the streamwise-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations.

It is not actually a working code base, since some of it components are to remain private.

This was done as part of my intership at the Laboratory for Turbulence Research in Aerospace and Combustion (LTRAC) in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Monash University, in Melbourne, Australia.

## What it is
It is an attempt to mimick OOC in FORTRAN, by means of Derived Data Types.
